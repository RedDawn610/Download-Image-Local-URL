This Flask web application allows users to download images from URLs directly to a specified download folder on their system. The main features of this application include:

    Image Downloading: Users can enter the URL of an image they wish to download. If the URL points to a valid image file (supported formats are PNG, JPG, JPEG, and GIF), the application will download the image to the DOWNLOAD_FOLDER on the user's system.

    Validation: The application checks if the provided URL is for an allowed image file type before attempting to download it.

    Feedback to Users: Through the use of Flask's flash messages, the application provides feedback about the download process. It informs the user whether the download was successful, if the file type was unsupported, or if there was an error during the download process.

    Automatic Browser Opening: Upon running the application, it automatically opens the default web browser to the application's home page where the user can start downloading images.

    Security: It uses werkzeug.utils.secure_filename to sanitize the file names of the downloaded images to avoid security issues.

    Customization: The download folder path is configurable, allowing users to specify where they want their images to be saved.

The application utilizes Flask for the web server and HTML templating, Requests for fetching images from URLs, and a combination of standard Python libraries for file handling and system interaction. The automatic opening of the web browser is achieved using the webbrowser module in conjunction with threading to delay the opening until after the server has started.
